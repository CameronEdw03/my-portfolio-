# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience through a modern, responsive design.

---

## ðŸš€ About the Project

This portfolio website is built with:

- **React JS** â€” for building a fast, interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€” for styling with utility-first CSS classes, making it highly customizable and responsive.
- **Figma** â€” the entire design and UI layout were created using Figma before development.

The portfolio is designed to be fully responsive and visually appealing across devices.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design

The UI/UX design was crafted in Figma, focusing on clean, minimal, and user-friendly experience. You can check the design file [here](#) *(replace with your Figma link if you want)*.
